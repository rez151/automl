Image preprocessing
    - Histogram Equalization
    - resizing
    - sorting (train, validation, test)

train models
    - different architectures
        - layers
        - neurons
        - inputsizes
    - different learningrates
    - different epochs
    - different weights / same amount of pics in classes
    - maybe use sthelse than generators
    - save model after each epoch -> /models

evaluate models
    - pic the best for accuracy and loss
    - script for modelsubmission -> /submissions
